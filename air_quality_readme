This project analyzes air pollution data to predict air quality using a classification model.
Objective
Predict air quality levels based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and pollutant levels.
The dataset includes:
Environmental factors: Temperature, humidity, NO2, CO levels, etc.(independant variable)
Target variable: air_quality (classification of air quality levels)
Libraries Used are:
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
