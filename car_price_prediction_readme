This project aims to build a Linear Regression Model to predict car prices based on various independent variables. The dataset includes attributes such as car name, engine type, engine size, and other specifications.

Objective

The model will help management understand how car prices vary with different features, enabling them to adjust car designs and business strategies to achieve specific pricing targets. Additionally, it provides insights into pricing dynamics in new markets.

Dataset

The dataset contains multiple features related to car specifications like ,Car Name,Engine Type,Engine Size,Horsepower,Mileage,Price (Target Variable)

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding relationships between variables.

Model Development: Implementing and training a Linear Regression model.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².

Technologies Used

Python,Pandas,seaborn ,matplotlib

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)
